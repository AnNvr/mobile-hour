# a word about authentication

The approach I have used it's the one they taught me at school of Web Dev, and it sets a server-side authentication in the Node.js backend environment. Further on with studying React I came across client-side authentication approaches using useRef and react-router-dom.

Although I have no personal preferences or strict beliefes for authentication approaches, I opted to keep the server-side approach because is generally more secure, the server handle access to the dataset based on user roles and validates the authentication key.
Also, this way doesn'tie the authentication logic to a specific framework library, allowing more flexibility of front-end production.
